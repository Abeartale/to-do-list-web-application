Coding challenge - To Do List for Ensolvers

Dependencies needed:
 - Java 11
 - Springboot 2.6.3
 - MySQL 8
 - Maven 3.8.4

I couldn't get the bash to create the SQL schema, but I attached the schema as a backup in the MySQL folder.

On the other hand, i had not worked with frontend yet.
I learned a lot about it and SPA programming in this last two days, but couldn't get it to work and decided not to include it.
